# 🌿 Skin Disease Detection Using Image Processing and Machine Learning

This project is a web-based application designed to detect skin diseases from uploaded images using image processing techniques and a trained machine learning model. The system provides disease classification, suggestions, and supports multilingual outputs for broader accessibility.

## 📌 Features

- Upload skin images to detect diseases.
- Deep learning model trained on skin disease dataset.
- Displays predicted disease name with useful suggestions.
- Translated outputs in multiple languages (Tamil, Hindi, French, Japanese, etc.).
- User-friendly interface built using HTML, CSS, JS, and PHP.
- Backend powered by Python (TensorFlow/Keras) for prediction.
- XAMPP used to manage local server and database.
